# Packaging Python applications

Notes, examples, [slides](Slides.md) for [PyCon Balkan 2018](https://pyconbalkan.com/).

## TODO

There were various discussions during the workshop regarding alternatives:
[PySpark](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/api/python/pyspark.html),
[airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), [NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/) and
[dask](https://dask.org/).

Follow up questions:

* How does Dask implement scheduling and how usable is it for general workflows?
